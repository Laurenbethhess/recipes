      "name": "French Onion Soup",
      "ingredients": [
        "5 sweet onions (like Vidalias) or a combination of sweet and red onions (about 4 pounds)",
        "3 tablespoons butter",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "2 cups white wine",
        "10 ounces canned beef consomme",
        "10 ounces chicken broth",
        "10 ounces apple cider (unfiltered is best)",
        "Bouquet garni; thyme sprigs, bay leaf and parsley tied together with kitchen string",
        "1 loaf country style bread",
        "Kosher salt",
        "Ground black pepper",
        "Splash of Cognac (optional)",
        "1 cup Fontina or Gruyere cheese, grated"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Trim the ends off each onion then halve lengthwise. Remove peel and finely slice into half-moon shapes. Set electric skillet to 300 degrees and add butter. Once butter has melted add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet. Do not try stirring until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning.",
        "Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency. Add consomme, chicken broth, apple cider and bouquet garni. Reduce heat and simmer 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Place oven rack in top 1/3 of oven and heat broiler.",
        "Cut country bread in rounds large enough to fit mouth of oven safe soup crocks. Place the slices on a baking sheet and place under broiler for 1 minute.",
        "Season soup mixture with salt, pepper and cognac. Remove bouquet garni and ladle soup into crocks leaving one inch to the lip. Place bread round, toasted side down, on top of soup and top with grated cheese. Broil until cheese is bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes."

      "name": "Chocolate Chip Cookies",
      "ingredients": [
        "8 ounces unsalted butter",
        "12 ounces bread flour",
        "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "2 ounces granulated sugar",
        "8 ounces light brown sugar",
        "1 large egg",
        "1 large egg yolk",
        "1 ounce whole milk",
        "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
        "12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Set aside to cool slightly.",
        "Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate. Pour the butter into your stand mixer's work bowl. Add the sugar and brown sugar and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, whisk together the whole egg, the egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract in a measuring cup. Reduce the mixer speed and slowly add the egg mixture. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.",
        "Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping a couple of times to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to 'stir' and add the chocolate chips. Chill the dough for 1 hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and place racks in the top third and bottom third of the oven.",
        "Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment-lined half sheet pans, 6 cookies per sheet. Bake 2 sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack and wait at least 5 minutes before devouring."
